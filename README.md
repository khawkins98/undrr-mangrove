# Mangrove: the UNDRR component library

[View the component library](https://unisdr.github.io/undrr-mangrove/)

## ðŸš¨ Pre-alpha warning ðŸš¨

This project is under active development and at the moment provides no useful resources. [Internal notes on the project can be seen in the GitLab Wiki](https://git.un.org/undrr/web-backlog/-/wikis/Mangrove:-the-UNDRR-Component-library).

## Purpose

This project stops short of being a full design system and instead focus on providing usable components that are informed by the UNDRR brand guidelines and project styles.

These components offer consistency, documentation and portability to speed quality development with the expected look and feel. These will also help reduce entropy, critical in ensuring websites remain accessible.

If there is a Component or Pattern that you need, or you have any other feedback, question or comment please contact us in the issue queue.
