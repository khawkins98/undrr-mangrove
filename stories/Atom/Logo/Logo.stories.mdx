# UNDP Logos
The UNDP logo is a keystone element of the identity and is used to represent the entire organization.

### Overview
The UNDP logo is the combination, in one fixed-size relationship, of the United Nations emblem and the letters “UNDP/PNUD”. The UNDP logo is the keystone element of the identity program and should be used to represent the entire organization.

When to use:
- To promote business.
- To create an identity for the organization.

### Formatting

#### Default
There are only two versions of the UNDP logo: UNDP (English) and PNUD (French/Spanish). Within the design system, the logo is used in the header and footer components. The logo is available in blue or white.

### Content
A well-established and consistently presented identity is a very valuable asset. To protect and strengthen the trademark status of the logo, the approved versions must not be altered, modified, changed, or added to in any way.

### Behaviors

#### States
The UNDP and PNUD logos are available in blue or white and used as per the page background.
