# Welcome

The purpose of this project is to act as a test to see if it is a suitable base for UNDRR's needs.

These projects will have a consistent look and feel and are accessible by just following the guidelines in the documentation.

By unifying design elements into reusable components, the development will simplify and accelerate the development of these digital products.

The Guide is a living document created to meet the needs of UNDP's front-end developers and designers. If there is a Component or Pattern that you need, or you have any other feedback, question or comment please contact us.

### Structure

Mangrove uses a loose [atomic design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) approach, but major concepts are split as follows:

- Getting started: high level information on what Mangrove is, and what you should and shouldn't do
- Design decisions: colours, spacing, typography and so on.
- Components: the bread and butter of cards, buttons and so on.

### Codebase

Code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/unisdr/undrr-mangrove) and through [a public Storybook website](https://unisdr.github.io/undrr-mangrove/).

Developers are encouraged to consume the project through the remotely available CSS to help ensure "up-to-date-ness".
